# Project status

The single place to see what is finished, what is in progress, and what is
still to do. Update this file whenever something changes.

Last updated: 2026-07-03 (pause switch + forever-renewing tokens)

## Latest: enterprise dashboard

The dashboard (docs/index.html) is now a single-page app with a left-side
menu showing one section at a time: **Dashboard** (stats, activity log,
recent runs), **Companies** (switch between clients, guided setup),
**Scheduled Posts** (the queue), **Auto Posts** (month campaigns),
**Admin** (Add Company creates the client's repo automatically on `main`),
**Setup Instructions** (plain-language walkthroughs of every credential),
and **Settings** (connection). Highlights:

- One-off post scheduling was removed; Auto Posts campaigns are the way to post.
- The platform lineup is Instagram and Facebook. TikTok was removed
  entirely (code, workflows, secrets and docs) at the owner's request.
- Every publish attempt (feed and stories, success or failure with the full
  API error) is written to `data/activity.json` and shown on the Dashboard.
- **Guided setup wizard** per company: modal steps with Next/Back and
  Save-and-Verify - GitHub token, Facebook Page (with automatic exchange to
  a permanent Page token), Instagram (auto-upgrade to long-lived), secret
  storage with copy buttons and existence verification, and GitHub Pages.
  Progress is saved so you can leave and return.
- Add Company (Admin) creates the repo from this template, renames the
  default branch to `main`, personalizes config.yaml, clears starter data,
  pre-loads the company card, and jumps straight into Guided setup.
- **Pause automation** button (Dashboard, per company): writes
  data/automation.json {paused}; the queue runner and content sync both
  honor it, so a company stops instantly and resumes with nothing lost.
- **Forever-renewing tokens:** Instagram (weekly refresh) and Facebook
  (weekly re-derive of a permanent Page token from the long-lived user
  token) both self-renew - set up once, never re-login.

## LIVE right now (audit 2026-07-03)

- "William Collins Ghost 1" Month 1 is ENABLED: 93 posts queued for
  Instagram + Facebook, Day 1 starting 2026-07-04, through 2026-07-23.
- GitHub Pages is serving the dashboard (branch deploy, builds green).
- All workflows green: scheduler, tests, token refresh.

## To do (user actions, not code)

- [ ] Facebook token: the old stored token was short-lived and expired 2 July,
  so Facebook mirrors fail until refreshed (Instagram is unaffected). Fix once:
  Companies -> Gwalava -> Guided setup -> Facebook step, store all FIVE secrets
  it gives you (page id, permanent page token, app id, app secret, user token).
  The new weekly job then re-derives a permanent Page token forever - this can
  never recur once the five secrets are in place.
- [ ] In the TikTok developer portal, delete the unused "Gwalava Poster" app (TikTok support was removed).

## To do (future improvements)

- [ ] LinkedIn and X (Twitter) publishers exist for text; wire them into the media queue like Facebook if ever needed.
- [ ] Dedicated per-client branding on the dashboard (logo upload).
- [ ] Per-campaign time zone: schedule and display in the client's IANA time
  zone instead of the operator's browser. Touches the scheduling core, so it
  is a deliberate follow-up rather than a quick change.
- [ ] Server-side/hub-repo company registry: today the list is browser-local
  with backup/restore. A true multi-device registry needs a designated hub
  repo (a product decision on where it lives) - deferred until chosen.

## Recently added

- **Approval gate:** every month batch has an "Approved to post" checkbox
  (Auto Posts). A month can be enabled but held for review - it only queues
  once approved. Existing campaigns (no approval flag) keep posting, so it is
  non-breaking. Card shows "awaiting approval" while an enabled month is
  unapproved.
- **Failure alerting:** when any publish fails, the queue runner POSTs a
  compact message to `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` (a Slack or Discord incoming webhook,
  or any endpoint - the body carries both `text` and `content`). Best effort:
  a dead webhook never blocks or crashes a posting run. Add the secret named
  `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` to turn it on; leave it unset to keep alerts off.
- **Analytics report:** a weekly job (Update analytics report) pulls likes,
  comments and reach/shares for every published post into data/report.json.
  The dashboard's **Reports** section shows totals and a post-by-post table;
  `docs/report.html?repo=owner/name` is a clean, controls-free, client-facing
  version safe to share as a link (reads the public report.json).
- **Client content preview:** `docs/preview.html?repo=owner/name` is a
  read-only, shareable calendar of upcoming scheduled posts (thumbnails,
  times, captions, platforms) for the client to review before it goes out.
  Opened from Scheduled Posts via "Open content preview".
- **Company list backup / restore:** the company registry (still browser
  local by design) can be exported to a JSON file and restored on another
  machine from the Companies section, so the list is portable and safe from
  a cleared browser. Tokens are included, so the file is stored privately.

## How a new client is onboarded (repeatable)

1. Open the dashboard's **Admin** section -> "Add Company".
2. Fill in the business name, description, phone, website; it creates their
   repo (default branch main), personalizes config.yaml, and clears starter
   data.
3. On the company's card (Companies section) run the **Guided setup**
   wizard: GitHub token, Facebook Page (permanent token), Instagram
   (long-lived token), then GitHub Pages - each step verifies itself.
4. Upload their content with **Bulk upload** into Month 1, set the month's
   date + platforms, tick it, Save. Done - it runs itself.

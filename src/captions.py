"""Randomized captions with brand, niche and viral hashtags.

Every auto-posted feed photo gets a unique caption assembled from a pool of
caption bodies, a rotating call to action, and a randomized hashtag block:
brand tags + niche tags + high-reach "viral" tags.

Bodies are drawn without replacement (reshuffled once the pool runs out), so
back-to-back posts never share a caption -- Instagram down-ranks and can flag
duplicated captions. Output respects Instagram's hard limits: max 2,200
characters and max 30 hashtags.

Multi-company: everything below (contact details, bodies, CTAs, tag pools) can
be overridden per business in config.yaml under a `captions:` section, so a
new client only edits config.yaml -- never this file. The built-in defaults
are for Gwalava Boards and Furniture Fittings.

    captions:
      contact_phone: "0813471724"
      contact_url: "https://example.com/"
      bodies: [ ... ]        # caption texts
      ctas: [ ... ]          # calls to action
      brand_tags: [ ... ]    # e.g. "#YourBrand"
      niche_tags: [ ... ]
